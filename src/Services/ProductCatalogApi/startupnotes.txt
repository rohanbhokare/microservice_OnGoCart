- Transient create each time, they are needed.
- Scoped created once for each request. Recommended for Entity Framework DbContext object.
- Single created once on first request(to the app) and then reused for the lifetime of the object.
this is the recommended approch vs. implementing your class as a single ton.
- Instanc similar to singleton, but create when instance is called vs on first request.
